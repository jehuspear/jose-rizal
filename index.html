                    <p>Educated in Manila and Europe, Rizal became a polymath, excelling as a physician, artist, writer, and scientist. His most famous works include the novels "Noli Me Tangere" and "El Filibusterismo," which exposed the injustices of Spanish colonial rule and inspired a growing nationalist movement.</p>
